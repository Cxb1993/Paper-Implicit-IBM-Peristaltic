Peristaltic pumping is a mechanism for transporting fluid prevalently utilized in both biological organisms and human designed systems. The mechanism induces flow in a channel by contracting the channel's walls in a set pattern. Peristaltic pumping of Newtonian fluids is well understood, and recent investigations have begun exploring the nature of peristalsis of non-Newtonian fluids. Here we investigate the particular case of peristalsis of an Oldroyd- B fluid via an Immersed Boundary method. We utilize a new, highly efficient semi-implicit solver for the equations of the flow and the immersed contracting walls which allows us to explore extreme parameter regimes, including those where the polymeric stress is many orders of magnitude larger than previously accessible to numerical experiments. In particular,  we consider large Weissenberg numbers and high channel occlusions. A new dynamic behavior is observed with substantial effects on the pumping flow rate, including evidence for a finite-time blow up of the Oldroyd- B equations.
