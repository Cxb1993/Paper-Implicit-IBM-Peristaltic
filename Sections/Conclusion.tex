Previous investigations into peristaltic pumping of OB fluids have revealed that the gross transport properties of the pump are highly sensitive to the underlying fluid parameters. Making use of a new implicit methodology we are able to explore a much broader parameter regime, observing new behavior both for high occlusion ratios and high Weissenberg numbers.

Future work will focus on extending this investigation to three dimensions, where preliminary results suggest new and different behavior. Importantly, in 3D we can investigate a plethora of novel asymmetrical pump geometries, including cork-screw like shapes. Preliminary results also suggest interesting differences when the OB fluid is replaced with a FENE-P fluid. Future work will explore these differences.
