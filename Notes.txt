Resolution Study
________________

W=1 X=.25 dt=.00025 N=256..2048
Plot max stress against time, each line for a different resolution
Plot mean flow against N, each line for a different value of T (do both styles for both mean flow and max stress?)

slope for flow vs N = -1.47955633813
slope for sup_s vs N = -1.80025518241

X=.8, W=5
_________

slope = 5286.80406717

Blowup. Uncleare why.

At a sufficiently low resolution the simulation is stable (N=256 and below, T = 50, maybe more),
at both dt = .00025 * (2048.0 / N)
and dt = .5 * .00025 * (2048.0 / N)

Need dt = .00025 * (2048.0 / N) for higher rez sims to get more stability, but sim still explodes
	For N=1024 the final time step is 7.44

Show succession of plots for N=1024
Discuss
	Point out boundary layer
	Initial super thin peak for T < 2, dissipates due to artificial diffusion?

Look at first period of pump over all resolutions (resolution study):

Full Jaffrin, All W, All X
__________________________

Show succession of plots for X=.5 and a range of W
Discuss
	Show complex structure, show it dissipates, why?
	Contrast with lack of structure for lower W, also compare vorticity against Stokes

Show succession of plots for W=50 over time, show dissipation
Discuss
	Aritifical dissipation responsible?
	Compare to upwinding

Show succession of plots for W=50 and a range of X
Discuss
	For small X nothing interesting happens

Graph how long the sims remain stable (X vs T), each line corresponds to a different W

Graph MeanFlow versus X, multiple lines for different W
	Multiple graphs for different points in time

!!!! redo sim



Jaffrin
_______

Plot curve for all X. All rho? Note that the discrepancy does not appear to be due to non-zero Reynolds number



Centered vs Artificial Diffusion vs ENO3

Compare plots for W=0,5,55
Note similar but stronger artificial diffusion for upwinding
